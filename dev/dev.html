        <p>
            Since elementary school I have been programming in Python, and in middle school I began programming in C# and later C++.
            In 8th grade I began programming in Cuda C to program on a GPGPU. Since then, I have worked for Applied Research Associates
            as a Technical Intern, where I have programmed various algorithms. In my junior year I began training for the United States
            of America Computing Olympiad, or USACO. My submissions to most of these endevours are below, and either link to github
            repositories or to code directly. My work here is organized chronologically.
